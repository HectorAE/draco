Scales
======

**Scales** is an interactive dragon experience. Exult in the sheer 
elemental power of your ancient bloodline. Don't play a dragon, _be_ a 
dragon. In this world, there is little to nothing holding you back from 
doing whatever you want.

This game is still in development. It is considered unstable and not
yet ready for distribution.
