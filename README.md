Scales
======

**Scales** is an interactive dragon experience. Exult in the sheer 
elemental power of your ancient bloodline. Don't play a dragon, _be_ a 
dragon. In this world, there is little to nothing holding you back from 
doing whatever you want.

This game is still in development. It is considered unstable and not
yet ready for distribution.

Install
-------

### Linux, BSD and Unix ###

The installation process for Unix-like systems is very simple. Open up
a shell (using a program called "Terminal" or "Console" or something like
that) and follow these instructions, assuming you cloned or downloaded the
repository into the directory "~/Downloads/scales":

```
cd Downloads/scales
ls # You should see the file "Makefile"
make
sudo make install
```

And there you go! Note that using this method, you cannot automatically
uninstall the game, as you could if you used a package or port.
